I developed these two programs to support the Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory in analyzing datasets with improved speed, accuracy, and reliability 
by minimizing human error. Previously, researchers compared text similarity based solely on word count, a time-consuming process with limited precision. My programs, however, 
uses a large language model and cosine similarity to assess semantic similarity or similarity in meaning, delivering accurate similarity ratings in a fraction of the time.
